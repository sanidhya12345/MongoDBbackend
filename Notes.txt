MongoClient: it is a lightweight /low -level mongo db driver it is ideal for simple and lightweight applications 

Advantages:

-->Lightweight and minimal.
-->Provides direct access to MongoDB's features and queries.
-->Faster for basic operations since thereâ€™s no abstraction layer.

Disadvantages:

-->No schema enforcement.
-->Requires more boilerplate code for CRUD operations.
-->Managing complex relationships and validations can be cumbersome. 


Mongoose
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library built on top of MongoDB's native driver.

Use Case:

Ideal for applications with complex data structures, where schema validation, relationships, and pre-/post-hooks (middleware) are needed.
Commonly used in frameworks like Express for building RESTful APIs or more structured Node.js applications.
Advantages:

Schema Enforcement: You can define data models with validation rules, default values, and type enforcement.
Middleware: You can add hooks (e.g., pre-save, post-save) for lifecycle events.
Relationships: Simplifies defining and managing references between documents (e.g., populate for joins).
Chaining Queries: Supports method chaining for cleaner query construction.
Abstraction: Reduces boilerplate code by providing built-in methods for CRUD operations.

Disadvantages:

Slightly heavier than MongoClient due to its abstraction layer.
Less flexible if you need raw access to MongoDB features.
Learning curve for developers not familiar with ODMs.
